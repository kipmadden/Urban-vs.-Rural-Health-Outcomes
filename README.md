# Urban vs Rural

We analyze health data from County Health Rankings and Roadmaps (a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation program) for Texas counties in the year 2019. We hypothesize that health outcomes for urban counties are better than rural.

In our analysis we discover the CDC's URCS for urban and rural county classification and extend our classification accordingly. We run analysis on both sets to reject our null hypothesis. 

See slideshow Urban_Rural_Health_Texas.pptx for further summarization of project.
